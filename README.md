# Diamond

_Diamond_ is a ***minimalistic***, ***powerful***, and ***modern*** [_Javascript_](https://www.javascript.com) runtime that uses _[Deno_Core](https://github.com/denoland/deno/tree/main/core)_.

# Installation

Diamond is currently in beta(not even Alpha!) and can't be currently installed. But you can build from source with `Make build`, and it will output an executable file called `Diamond` that you can use! 

# Usage

Diamond is build on Javascript, and is like it in almost every single way. But there are a couple things changed, for example, the `console.log` that we all know, has been changed, to `println`, and to use it:

``` javascript
println("Hello, world!");
```
